Hello, I'm Felicia Andrea Tandoko. As a passionate Data Science student, I love diving into the world of data to uncover insights that can make a difference. With a strong foundation in data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and machine learning, I enjoy using tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau to transform complex datasets into compelling stories.

Outside of my studies, I stay active through exercise and enjoy baking as a way to unwind and express my creativity. Reading is another passion of mine that helps me explore new ideas and perspectives. Iâ€™m eager to connect with professionals and organizations that share my enthusiasm for leveraging data to create impactful solutions.
